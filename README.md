# Property Information rewriter and summary generator Django Application #

This project is a Django-based Command Line Interface (CLI) application that rewrites property titles and descriptions using an Ollama model and stores the updated information in a PostgreSQL database. Additionally, it generates summaries of the property information and saves them in a separate table.


## Features ##
- **Django CLI Integration**: All operations are performed through a command-line interface, leveraging Django's management commands.
- **Ollama Model Integration**: Utilizes a model from Ollama for rewriting content and generating summaries.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores rewritten property titles, descriptions, and generated summaries using Django ORM.
- **Summary Generation**: Automatically generates and stores property summaries in a separate table.
- **Django Admin Interface:** Manage property summary with proper authentication.

## Installation ##

### Prerequisites ###
1. Python
2. Django
3. PostgreSQL
4. Ollama model setup ( PLease refer to [Ollama documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main))
5. Git

### Steps ###

1. **Clone and navigate to the the Repository.**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mashrufehsan/W3-LLM-Assignment.git
    cd W3-LLM-Assignment
    ```
2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment.**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. **Install Dependencies.**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Configure environment variables.**

    Copy the .env.sample file to .env and fill in the required configuration.
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        cp .env.sample .env
        ```
    - On windows:
        ```bash
        copy .env.sample .env
        ```
    
    Update the `.env` file with your PostgreSQL database credentials and specify the Ollama model of your choice.

5. **Run Migrations**
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
6. **Start the CLI application**
    ```bash
    python manage.py generate_summary
    ```
Upon running the application, you will be prompted to enter the superuser admin `username` and `password`.

Once authenticated, the application will rewrite property titles and descriptions, generate summaries from the available data, and store the summaries in a separate table.

## Admin Interface ##
Once the server is running, the Djnago admin interface can be accessed at:
> http://localhost:8000/admin


## Models
This CLI application generates a property_summary table, delivering an insightful summary of property data.
